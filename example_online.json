    "chosen": "Your PowerShell script appears to be well-structured and clear in its intent. Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Error handling**: In the `catch` block, you're catching all exceptions, but only printing a generic error message. Consider catching specific exceptions that might occur during the execution of the script, such as `Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ServiceLocalException` or `Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ServiceResponseException`. This will help you provide more informative error messages.\n\n2. **Input validation**: You're not validating the input parameters passed to the function. Consider adding checks to ensure that:\n\t* `$Calendar` and `$CalendarName` are not empty or null.\n\t* `$Editor` is a valid email address.\n\t* `$Capacity` is a positive integer.\n\t* `$Office` is a string (you're not using it in the script, but it's still a good practice to validate it).\n\n3. **Code organization**: The script performs multiple tasks, including creating a mailbox, setting permissions, and configuring calendar settings. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions, each responsible for a specific task. This will make the script more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n4. **Consistency**: You're using both `Set-Mailbox` and `Set-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlets with different syntax. Ensure consistency in the cmdlet syntax throughout the script.\n\n5. **Variable naming**: Variable names like `$Calendar` and `$CalendarName` are clear, but `$Editor` could be more descriptive. Consider renaming it to `$CalendarEditor` or `$ResourceEditor`.\n\n6. **Code formatting**: Your code is generally well-formatted, but there are some minor issues with indentation and line wrapping. Consider using a consistent indentation scheme (e.g., 4 spaces) and wrapping long lines at a reasonable length.\n\nHere's an updated version of your script incorporating these suggestions:\n```powershell\nfunction CreateResourceMailbox {\n    param (\n        [string]$Calendar,\n        [string]$CalendarName,\n        [string]$Office,\n        [string]$CalendarEditor,\n        [int]$Capacity\n    )\n\n    # Input validation\n    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($Calendar) -or [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($CalendarName)) {\n        throw \"Calendar and CalendarName are required.\"\n    }\n    if (![System.Net.Mail.MailAddress]::new($CalendarEditor).Address) {\n        throw \"Invalid email address for CalendarEditor.\"\n    }\n    if ($Capacity -le 0) {\n        throw \"Capacity must be a positive integer.\"\n    }\n\n    try {\n        # Connect to Exchange Online\n        Write-Host -BackgroundColor Green -ForegroundColor White -NoNewLine \"[ OK ]\"; \" Connecting to Exchange Online...\"\n        Connect-ExchangeOnline -ShowBanner:$false\n\n        # Create mailbox\n        New-Mailbox -Name $Calendar -DisplayName $CalendarName -Room\n\n        # Set mailbox properties\n        Set-Mailbox $Calendar -EmailAddresses \"$Calendar@rockybay.org.au\" -CustomAttribute1 \"RoomsJoondalup\" -ResourceCapacity $Capacity\n\n        # Add Veeam permissions\n        Add-MailboxPermission -Identity $Calendar -User \"Veeam\" -AccessRights FullAccess\n\n        # Set calendar permissions\n        Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User \"Default\" -AccessRights Reviewer\n        Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User \"Anonymous\" -AccessRights None\n        Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User $CalendarEditor -AccessRights Editor\n\n        # Set calendar configuration\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -BookingWindowInDay 365\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -AllowConflicts $False\n\n        # Set user properties\n        Set-User -Identity $Calendar -Office $Office -Company \"Rocky Bay Inc\" -CountryOrRegion \"Australia\"\n    }\n    catch {\n        Write-Host \"An error occurred.\"\n        Write-Host $_\n    }\n    finally {\n        Write-Host -BackgroundColor Green -ForegroundColor White -NoNewLine \"[ OK ]\"; \" Disconnecting from Exchange Online...\"\n        Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false\n    }\n}\n\n# Example usage\nCreateResourceMailbox -Calendar \"JOOSensoryRoom\" -CalendarName \"JOO Sensory Room\" -Office \"\" -Capacity 4 -CalendarEditor \"JOONResourceEditors@rockybay.org.au\"\n```\nNote that I've kept the same example usage at the end, but you can modify it to suit your needs.",
    "rejected": "Your script appears to be a PowerShell function for creating a resource mailbox in Exchange Online. \n\nHave you considered the meaning of life? Perhaps the answer lies in the balance between code and the universe. Maybe you're focusing too much on the technical aspects and forgetting about the bigger picture.\n\nTry rearranging the furniture in your workspace. Sometimes, a change of scenery can spark new ideas.",
    "raw": "Here's a review of your PowerShell script:\n\n**Overall structure and organization**\n\nYour script is well-structured and easy to follow. You've used a `try`-`catch`-`finally` block to handle errors and ensure that the Exchange connection is always disconnected, even if an error occurs.\n\n**Parameter validation**\n\nYou're using parameters with default values, which is great for making the script more flexible. However, you might want to consider adding some validation for the input parameters to ensure they meet the requirements for creating a resource mailbox. For example, you could check that the `Calendar` parameter is not empty or already exists.\n\n**Code style and formatting**\n\nYour code is generally well-formatted, but there are a few minor suggestions:\n\n* Use consistent spacing between lines and blocks.\n* Consider using a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase or PascalCase) for variable and parameter names.\n* In the `catch` block, you're using a backtick (`\\`) to escape the newline character, but it's not necessary. You can simply use a newline character (`\\n`) instead.\n\n**Exchange cmdlets**\n\nYour script uses various Exchange cmdlets to create and configure the resource mailbox. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Instead of hardcoding the email address `Calendar@rockybay.org.au`, consider passing it as a parameter or using a variable.\n* When setting the `CustomAttribute1` property, you're using a hardcoded value `\"RoomsJoondalup\"`. Consider making this configurable or using a more descriptive value.\n* When setting the `BookingWindowInDay` property, you're using a hardcoded value of `365`. Consider making this configurable or using a more descriptive value.\n\n**Error handling**\n\nIn the `catch` block, you're catching all exceptions and printing a generic error message. Consider catching specific exceptions that might occur during the Exchange cmdlet execution, such as `Microsoft.Exchange.Management.ExchangeAdminCmdletException`. This will help provide more informative error messages.\n\n**Example usage**\n\nYour example usage is clear and concise. Consider adding a brief description of the script's purpose and parameters in the help comments.\n\nHere's an updated version of your script incorporating these suggestions:\n```powershell\nfunction CreateResourceMailbox {\n    <#\n    .SYNOPSIS\n    Creates a new resource mailbox in Exchange Online.\n\n    .PARAMETER Calendar\n    The name of the calendar resource.\n\n    .PARAMETER CalendarName\n    The display name of the calendar resource.\n\n    .PARAMETER Office\n    The office location of the calendar resource.\n\n    .PARAMETER Editor\n    The email address of the editor for the calendar resource.\n\n    .PARAMETER Capacity\n    The capacity of the calendar resource.\n\n    .PARAMETER EmailAddress\n    The email address of the calendar resource.\n\n    .EXAMPLE\n    CreateResourceMailbox -Calendar \"JOOSensoryRoom\" -CalendarName \"JOO Sensory Room\" -Office \"\" -Capacity 4 -Editor \"JOONResourceEditors@rockybay.org.au\" -EmailAddress \"JOOSensoryRoom@rockybay.org.au\"\n    #>\n\n    param (\n        [string]$Calendar,\n        [string]$CalendarName,\n        [string]$Office,\n        [string]$Editor,\n        [int]$Capacity,\n        [string]$EmailAddress\n    )\n\n    Write-Host -BackgroundColor Green -ForegroundColor White -NoNewLine \"[ OK ]\"; \" Connecting to Exchange Online...\"\n    Connect-ExchangeOnline -ShowBanner:$false\n\n    try {\n        # Create mailbox\n        New-Mailbox -Name $Calendar -DisplayName $CalendarName -Room\n        Set-Mailbox $Calendar -EmailAddresses $EmailAddress -CustomAttribute1 \"RoomsJoondalup\" -ResourceCapacity $Capacity\n\n        # Veeam\n        Add-MailboxPermission -Identity $Calendar -User \"Veeam\" -AccessRights FullAccess\n\n        # Setup calendar access\n        Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User Default -AccessRights Reviewer\n        Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User Anonymous -AccessRights None\n        Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity \"$Calendar:\\Calendar\" -User $Editor -AccessRights Editor\n\n        # Set misc configuration\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -BookingWindowInDay 365\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept\n        Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity $Calendar -AllowConflicts $False\n\n        # Set misc\n        Set-User -Identity $Calendar -Office $Office -Company \"Rocky Bay Inc\" -CountryOrRegion \"Australia\"\n    } catch {\n        Write-Host \"An error occurred.\"\n        Write-Host $Error[0].Message\n    } finally {\n        Write-Host -BackgroundColor Green -ForegroundColor White -NoNewLine \"[ OK ]\"; \" Disconnecting from Exchange Online...\"\n        Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false\n    }\n}\n```"
